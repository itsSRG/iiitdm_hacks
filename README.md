# Google Developer Student Club (iiitdm_hacks)

## Problem Statement

Every year we have many first-years and new joinees in our Institute. With the excitement of entering the institute also comes a lot of questions on the study, culture, faculty , process etc. 

People in 2/3rd year can understand the kind of confusion they face while opting for elective.
On the other side, faculties are also facing an issue wherein they have to answer the same / similar questions of students repeatedly. This happens every year. Adding to this, each year a new rule is formed by the senate thus making it even more puzzling as what may apply for one batch may not for the other. Thus as a whole itâ€™s a complicated issue, but has a simple solution.

## Solution

A community based query management system for IIITDM wherein any student can post any query regarding his/her issue and the student community / administration can answer or verify the same. Each of the questions can be tagged according to topic from the given set of tags so that one could search and retrieve the question before asking a similar one in the forum.
